# Retail Price Optimization

This project focuses on retail price optimization, aiming to determine the most suitable pricing strategies for products in a retail environment. We leverage various machine learning models, including k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, and Random Forest, to find the most effective pricing approach.

## Introduction

Effective pricing strategies are essential for retail businesses. Price optimization involves finding the ideal balance between maximizing profit and maintaining customer satisfaction. This project explores different machine learning models to determine the most suitable pricing strategies.

## Features

The dataset used in this project includes various features, such as:
- Product attributes (e.g., category,id,qty and etc.)
- Unit price 

## Models

We have experimented with several machine learning models, including:

1. **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** KNN is a non-parametric model that uses the prices of neighboring products to predict the optimal price for a given product.

2. **Linear Regression:** Linear regression models the relationship between product attributes and prices using a linear equation. It serves as a baseline model for price prediction.

3. **Random Forest:** Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to predict prices. It is known for its flexibility and performance.

## Best Model

Among the models explored, the Random Forest model has proven to be the most effective in optimizing retail prices. It provides accurate predictions, taking into account the complex interactions between various features. The Random Forest model is recommended for retail price optimization in this context.

## Usage

To use the Random Forest model for retail price optimization:

1. Ensure you have the required dataset and data preprocessing in place.
2. Train the Random Forest model with your data, adjusting hyperparameters as needed.
3. Use the trained model to predict optimal prices for your retail products.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics (e.g., mean absolute error, R-squared).

Feel free to explore other models, such as KNN and Linear Regression, and compare their performance against the Random Forest model.
